**Example Flow**:
1. **User Registration**: A user registers through the **User Service**.
2. **Book Browsing**: The user browses available books using the **Book Inventory Service**.
3. **Order Placement**: The user places an order through the **Order Service**.

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Define Protobuf Files**:
   - Create Protobuf messages for user data, book details, and orders.
   - Define the gRPC services for user management, book inventory, and order processing.

2. **Implement Services**:
   - **User Service**: Implement user registration, authentication, and management.
   - **Book Inventory Service**: Implement book addition, updating, and availability checks.
   - **Order Service**: Implement order placement, status updates, and history retrieval.

3. **Set Up Communication**:
   - Ensure that services can communicate with each other using gRPC.
   - Implement gRPC clients within each service to interact with other services.

4. **Containerization**:
   - Create Dockerfiles for each service.
   - Build Docker images and run the services in separate containers.

5. **Client Application**:
   - Develop a client application to interact with the services, enabling users to register, browse books, and place orders.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test each service independently.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure that all services work together seamlessly.
